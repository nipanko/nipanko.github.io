Voxel rendering presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional polygon meshes, voxel worlds can consume enormous amounts of memory. A `1024x1024x1024` volume is over a billion voxels!

### Sparse Voxel Octrees
SVOs are a tree data structure used to efficiently store sparse voxel data. Instead of storing every voxel, we only store regions of space that contain detail. This dramatically reduces memory usage and allows for efficient traversal on the GPU.
